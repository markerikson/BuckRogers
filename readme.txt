Version 0.8.0 (Beta)

"Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century" is a trademark of the Dille Family Trust, and is used without permission.


System Requirements

* A reasonably modern PC (1GHZ+)
* The .NET 2.0 Framework, available from Microsoft (may also run on the cross-platform Mono framework - currently not tested).


Changes

Version 0.8.0 has a huge number of changes from 0.7.8.  Here's some of the big ones (see changelog.txt for more details - follow the link from the Buck Rogers page at isquaredsoftware.com):

* Now requires the .NET Framework version 2.0 instead of .NET 1.1
* Replaced the old spreadsheet-like Combat Screen with a nice shiny new point-n-click one.
* Added the ability to choose units to move by clicking on their icons
* Added several optional rules and setup options, including "pre-game unit selection", "no cost to move between outer orbits and the solar system", and "planets don't move"
* Added "About" and "How to Play" windows (plus a very nice logo that I'm quite proud of, even if it is a reproduction of the one from the game box)
* Lots of bugfixes and usability tweaks


Introduction

Thanks for downloading the Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century computer conversion.  This conversion was created with the goal of allowing easier, faster play of one of my favorite board games.  I've put a lot of work into this, and hope you enjoy it.

The project is not finished (hence the "beta" label), but the current version is very stable and should allow playing a complete game without any problems.  Currently, Buck Rogers only supports 2-6 players, all taking turns on one computer.  I hope to add networked multiplayer and computer AI in the future.


The rules for the Buck Rogers board game are available for download from the Buck Rogers page on the ISquared Software website.  An overview of how to play the game can be found by clicking "Help -> How To Play".
