Version 0.7.2
- ADD: 	"Add All" buttons to the combat and movement windows
- ADD:  Initial code for optional rule "Only ground troops can conquer territories".
		Should work, but haven't tried it yet.  Note that this only applies
		to planetside territories - asteroids and satellites can still be captured
		by other units.
- CHG: 	Revamp of the way the combat screen buttons are activated.  Should be
		simpler and take fewer clicks now.
- BUG:  Factory production dis/enabled appropriately when transported
- BUG:  Leaders can no longer conquer territories
- BUG:  Ownership error when building a Killer Satellite on an asteroid
- BUG:  Production screen needed to skip factories that are being transported
- BUG:  Combat should now handle combat where a side has only a leader
